Char values are surrounded by single quotes\n- string - stores text such as 'hello world'. String values are surrounded by double quotes.\n- bool - stores values with true or false.\n- Void - when used as a function return type, the void keyword specifies that the function doesn't return a value.\n"},

Thus cout srefers to character output. We use the insertion operator (<<) along with cout to output formatted data . cout in C++ is defined in the iostream header file.\n"},

For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight, colour and methods, such as drive and brake.\n- Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belong to the class. These are referred as class members.\n- A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a blueprint for creating objects.\n- In C++, an object is created from a class.\n"},
